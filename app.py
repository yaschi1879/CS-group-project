# We hereby declare that the vast majority of the code for this project has been written by us independently. 
# We have utilized ChatGPT as a tool for conceptual purposes and for assistance with small, 
# specific parts of the code, such as generating comments or clarifying implementation ideas.
# However, all critical design decisions, core functionality, 
# and the implementation of the primary codebase were developed through our own efforts and understanding.
